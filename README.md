![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Sahil12524/Minecraft-Launch-Script/total?color=g&style=for-the-badge)

Hello all this is Sahil Bhandari and I have build a Minecraft Launch Script for Windows Edition Minecraft trial bypass.
This Script baically skips the licence verification and does not ask players to buy full version minecraft.
Players can enjoy 3rd party servers and unlimited times trial period even if it says trial period in game while you play.
Thankyou...
