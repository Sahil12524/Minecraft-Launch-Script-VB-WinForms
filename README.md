# Minecraft Launch Script

Hello all this is Sahil Bhandari and I have build a Minecraft Launch Script for Windows Edition Minecraft trial bypass.
This Script baically skips the licence verification and does not ask players to buy full version minecraft.
Players can enjoy 3rd party servers and unlimited times trial period even if it says trial period in game while you play.
Thankyou...
## Acknowledgements

Idea behind this launcher:
Every youtuber has a common solution that is delete the original DLL and replace those DLL with the modified one.
But then if you use moded DLL then Microsoft Store will not work eg. You cannot download any apps from the store nor you can update your apps.
Non of the youtuber has told us to backup the original DLL nor showed us how to restore the original DLL.
So I thought why not just not only backup the original DLL with the original permission but also restore them afterwards.
I started to build my script to backup the original DLL.
I tested the script multiple times to verify that everything is running properly.
But what if you do not restore original DLL?
Your windows apps will never going to update nor they Will download.
Then I found something strange:
Whenever windows gets updated, the DLL also gets updated after each updated.
I figured that out and build a tracker logic, if the backup DLL needs to be updated or not.
I used the UWP inspired UI style.
Learned many thing during the development journey.
